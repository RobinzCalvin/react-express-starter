# React application with Express server

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Then an Express server was added in the `server` directory. The server is proxied via the `proxy` key in `package.json`.

## Using this project

Clone the project, change into the directory and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/philnash/react-express-starter.git
cd react-express-starter
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file for environment variables in your server.

You can start the server on its own with the command:

```bash
npm run server
```

Run the React application on its own with the command:

```bash
npm start
```

Run both applications together with the command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The React application will run on port 3000 and the server port 3001.

## React Twilio starter

The [twilio branch](https://github.com/philnash/react-express-starter/tree/twilio) is a similar setup but also provides endpoints with basic [Access Tokens](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/access-tokens) for [Twilio Programmable Chat](https://www.twilio.com/docs/chat) and [Twilio Programmable Video](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video). You can use the project as a base for building React chat or video applications.
